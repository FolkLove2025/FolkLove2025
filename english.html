            <p>On December 11, 2024 we had pleasure to take part in an unique meeting with Ms. Jadwiga Krze≈õniak, a local folklore enthusiast. She introduced us to the disappearing traditions and rituals associated with Christmas. We gained unique access to her father's fascinating notes and learned how to create a variety of ornaments that used to adorn Christmas trees. 
                Ms. Krze≈õniak talked about the symbolism of those special decorations and told us about interesting and amusing proverbs related to the weather. We took this opportunity to record a short interview, in which Ms. Krze≈õniak shares her knowledge and passion for folklore. 
                We highly recommend watching it on our project‚Äôs social media profiles, where you can find detailed coverage of the event. If you are interested in our project, please like this post and follow our social media channels

            <p>On December 2, 2024, on the initiative of students implementing the FolkLove2025 project as part of the Zwolnieni z Teorii Olympiad, Christmas workshops were held led by Mrs. Edyta Sak from the Regional Museum in ≈Åuk√≥w and Mr. Krzysztof Osak, who are both folk artists. During the workshops, participants made wafer stars, which were traditional decorations placed on ‚Äòpod≈Ça≈∫niczka‚Äô ‚Äì a traditional Polish and Slovak Christmas decoration. ‚ùÑÔ∏èüå®Ô∏èüéÑ
                The pod≈Ça≈∫niczka, hung from the ceiling above the Christmas Eve table, was decorated with apples, nuts, paper decorations and stars made of colorful wafer. The branches (or the top) of a coniferous tree were cut down to make a pod≈Ça≈∫niczka on Christmas Eve very early in the morning, and the farmer who was the first to bring it into the room was to ensure the earliest growth and ripening of the grain in the coming year.
                Mrs. Edyta Sak introduced the youth to Polish Christmas traditions and customs in a picturesque way, showing the richness of their symbolism. For example, the number twelve simultaneously refers to the twelve apostles, the twelve months of the year and the twelve Christmas Eve dishes. The end of Advent was announced by playing the ligawa, a traditional instrument on which the students had the opportunity to try their skill during the workshops. Although playing the ligawa is not easy, our mate, Mateusz WasƒÖ≈ºnik, managed to master the basics of this art. üé≠üñºÔ∏èüåàü©∑
                The students passionately listened to the presenters‚Äô story and were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to make their own decorations from colorful wafers.
                The organization of the workshops was possible thanks to the financial support of the Parents Council, for which we are very grateful. Such initiatives not only promote, but also remind us of Polish traditions, which, although little known, are extremely interesting and valuable. üå®Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüéÅüå†

            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>The <b>FolkLove2025</b> project promotes folk traditions and culture. We aim to familiarize young people with rituals related to holidays and encourage them to expand their knowledge on this subject. Our goal is to ensure that folk traditions are not forgotten and find their place in daily life.</p>
            <p>Folk culture is the foundation of our national identity. It has helped us endure the partitions and repressions during World War II.</p>
            <p>As part of the project, we plan to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Herody Garwoli≈Ñskie:</b> Revive the tradition of staging this performance, last held in 1984.</li>
                <li><b>Book publication:</b> A book by Mrs. Jadwiga Krze≈õniak with a chapter on bread baking traditions by Mrs. Angelika Chabrowska.</li>
